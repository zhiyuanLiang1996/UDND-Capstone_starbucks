## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The Junpyter Notebook is written using Python 3 with default Anaconda Distribution and several other libraries. In specific, the following libraries should be installed:
- Numpy

- re  
- seaborn

If you start with Anaconda default, then you may not need to do anything

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I analyzed Starbucks customers' behavior dataset. It's simulated based on Starbuck's customers. I want to analyze the customers clusters. And analyze their response to different types of offers. In the project, I find a lot of customers have only limited demographic information. Analyzing their clusters is also a key question.

The questions that guide my analysis are

1. What's the customers' group?
2. What's their response to different types of offers?
3. What's the corresponding business strategy?
3. What's the composition of the 'missing-value' customers?
